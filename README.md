# Linux ALSA sound generation examples
Contains a collection of programs which generate sound using the native linux ALSA API


### Compilation
There is a simple script for building programs.
Which can be run (when in the local repo folder) by typing: `bash buildIt.bash`

For compilng the program a `libsound2` development package needs to be installed.
The build script will attempt to install in case it is not installed on your linux OS.


### TODOs
- place commonly used function in a dedicated translation unit
- more code refactors
- add cmake building
